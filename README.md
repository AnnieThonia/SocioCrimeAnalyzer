# Analysis of Crime and Social Factors

“The SocioCrimeAnalyzer repository focuses on the analysis of crime and its correlation with socio-economic factors. This project is of interest to a wide audience as crime affects almost everyone, including individuals and businesses. The analysis aims to identify areas of social inequality and deprivation, and develop approaches to crime prevention that address the underlying social determinants of crime. This data-driven approach can provide valuable insights for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and social organizations.”
